(* Reentrant buffers :
   If you call a function that needs a buffer, you might want to use this
   module to reuse such buffers, instead of reallocating them everytime.

   This module is not thread-safe. Reentrance is only provided for a function
   that uses a buffer, and might call another function using a similar
   buffer.

   Buffer sizes should be between 4kB and 1MB.
